The first SQL tutorial on FCC
=============================

taken from the FCC's page on beginner SQL, it starts with some recommendations, then goes through the most basic basics, which I work through here.

Looking at the student table.

Remember, to look at columns in a table:

```{sql}

-- Had to modify the code from the FreeCodeCamp tutorial to make it work for postgres. Apparently there's an even cleaner way than this, using concat() or something to that effect
-- I never would've realised I had to do this if I didn't make the effort to create this student table!

select firstname, lastname, firstname || ' ' || lastname AS fullname
from student;

```

To create a table:

```{sql}

CREATE TABLE Persons (
ID int NOT NULL,
LastName varchar(255) NOT NULL,
FirstName varchar(255),
Age int,
CHECK (Age>=18) -- This ensures everyone records their age at 18 years old or older
);

```

To give our CHECK constraint a name:

```{sql}

ALTER TABLE Persons
ADD constraint CHK_PersonAge;

-- And drop the named constraint

ALTER TABLE Persons
DROP constraint CHK_PersonAge;

-- interesting in MySQL the syntax requires 'check' instead of 'constraint' here, but in PostgreSQL the syntax is 'constraint'...
-- not sure why that's interesting, except that postgres is written by the authors of MySQL...

```

```{sql}

SELECT studentID, fullname, sat_score, rcd_updated
FROM student;

```


> Please see the manual for your database manager and have fun trying different options yourself.

Lol!

How do I:

- quickly duplicate (backup) a table?
- quickly populate a table with information?

It's really hard working through these examples without the actual table. Might be worth just going through and adding the student table to my database, one line at a time, just to burn the syntax into my muscles.
