The first SQL tutorial on FCC
=============================

taken from the FCC's page on beginner SQL, it starts with some recommendations, then goes through the most basic basics, which I work through here.

Looking at the student table.

Remember, to look at columns in a table:

```{sql}

SELECT someColumn, someotherColumn, columnN
FROM TableName;

```

To create a table:

```{sql}

CREATE TABLE Persons (
ID int NOT NULL,
LastName varchar(255) NOT NULL,
FirstName varchar(255),
Age int,
CHECK (Age>=18) -- This ensures everyone records their age at 18 years old or older
);

```

To give our CHECK constraint a name:

```{sql}

ALTER TABLE Persons
ADD constraint CHK_PersonAge;

-- And drop the named constraint

alter table Persons
drop constraint CHK_PersonAge;

-- interesting in MySQL the syntax requires 'check' instead of 'constraint' here, but in PostgreSQL the syntax is 'constraint'...
-- not sure why that's interesting, except that postgres is written by the authors of MySQL...

```

> Please see the manual for your database manager and have fun trying different options yourself.

Lol!

How do I:

- quickly duplicate (backup) a table?
- quickly populate a table with information?

It's really hard working through these examples without the actual table. Might be worth just going through and adding the student table to my database, one line at a time, just to burn the syntax into my muscles.
